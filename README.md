# PIPO-ShiftRegister
Loads 16-bit data in parallel on the load signal.  Outputs 16-bit data in parallel simultaneously.  Supports left, right, arithmetic left, and right shifts controlled by shift_en.  Updates output synchronously on clock's positive edge.  Resets output to zero on active reset.  Used for temporary parallel data storage and manipulation.
